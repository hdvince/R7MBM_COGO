## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r COMEinitiationstats}
init.COME
```

## 


```{r initiation}
summary(a.initiation)
```
## Hen Status

The following is a histogram of..

```{r hen-status, echo=FALSE}
print(hen.status.plot)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
